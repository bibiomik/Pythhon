# Python

I took a Data Rock Bootcamp course and learned how to use Python to work with data! It was awesome. Now I can use tools like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze data.

I can also grab data from databases using special tools called APIs, and even build cool things like machine learning models.
